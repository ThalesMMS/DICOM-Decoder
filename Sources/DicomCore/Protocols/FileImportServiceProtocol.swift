//
//  FileImportServiceProtocol.swift
//
//  Protocol abstraction for DICOM file import operations.
//  Defines the public API for importing DICOM files and ZIP archives,
//  handling file extraction, and managing secure file storage.
//  Implementations must support async operations for file I/O and provide
//  appropriate user feedback during long-running operations.
//
//  Thread Safety:
//
//  All protocol methods should be called from the MainActor context
//  for UI-related operations. Implementations handle file system
//  synchronization internally.
