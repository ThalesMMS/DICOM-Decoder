/// Thread-safe buffer pool for DICOM pixel data recycling.
///
/// **Design Decision: Buffer Pool Architecture**
///
/// This implementation uses size-based bucketing with type-specific pools to reduce
/// allocation overhead when processing series of similar-sized images.
///
/// **Key Design Choices:**
///
/// 1. **Size-Based Bucketing**: Buffers are organized into fixed-size buckets
///    (256×256, 512×512, 1024×1024, 2048×2048) to prevent fragmentation and
///    maximize reuse. Requests are rounded up to the next bucket size.
///
/// 2. **Type-Specific Pools**: Separate pools for UInt16, UInt8, Int16, Float,
///    and Data types prevent type confusion and enable efficient memory reuse
///    without costly conversions.
///
/// 3. **Thread-Safe Access**: Uses `DicomLock` (os_unfair_lock) for synchronization.
///    Pool operations are fast (<1ms) and lock contention is minimal since buffers
///    are typically acquired/released at slice boundaries.
///
/// 4. **Lazy Allocation**: Buffers are created on-demand. The pool starts empty
///    and grows as needed, avoiding upfront memory pressure.
///
/// 5. **Manual Memory Management**: No automatic eviction policy to avoid
///    unpredictable performance. Users call `clear()` explicitly or respond to
///    memory pressure notifications.
///
/// **Performance Characteristics:**
///
/// - Pool hit: ~0.1ms (array reuse)
/// - Pool miss: ~50-200ms (new allocation + initialization)
/// - Target hit rate: >70% for series processing
/// - Expected allocation reduction: <50% of baseline for 100+ slice series
///
/// **Usage Example:**
///
/// ```swift
/// let pool = BufferPool.shared
///
/// // Acquire a buffer from the pool
/// let buffer = pool.acquire(type: [UInt16].self, count: 512 * 512)
///
/// // Use the buffer...
/// // processPixels(buffer)
///
/// // Release back to pool when done
/// pool.release(buffer)
///
/// // Check pool statistics
/// let stats = pool.statistics
/// print("Hit rate: \(stats.hitRate)%, Current pool size: \(stats.currentPoolSize)")
///
/// // Clear pools under memory pressure
/// pool.clear()
/// ```
///
/// **Memory Pressure Handling:**
///
/// The pool integrates with system memory pressure notifications (added in phase 4):
/// - Warning level: Release 50% of pooled buffers
/// - Critical level: Release all pooled buffers
/// - Manual clearing: Call `clear()` for immediate release
///
/// This design balances performance (avoiding repeated allocations) with memory
/// efficiency (releasing buffers when needed).
