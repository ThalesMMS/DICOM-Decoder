/// Memory pressure monitoring using DispatchSource for automatic buffer pool cleanup.
///
/// **Design Decision: DispatchSource vs NotificationCenter**
///
/// This implementation uses `DispatchSource.makeMemoryPressureSource()` rather than
/// `NotificationCenter` (UIApplication.didReceiveMemoryWarningNotification) because:
///
/// 1. **Platform Independence**: Works on both iOS and macOS without UIKit dependency.
///    The library targets iOS 13+ and macOS 12+, and DispatchSource is available on both.
///
/// 2. **System-Level Integration**: DispatchSource provides direct access to kernel-level
///    memory pressure events with finer granularity (.warning, .critical).
///
/// 3. **Non-UI Context**: The DICOM library operates independently of UI layer, so
///    UIApplication notifications are not available in all contexts (e.g., command-line tools,
///    frameworks, background processes).
///
/// 4. **Lower Latency**: Kernel-level events arrive faster than NotificationCenter messages
///    which must traverse the runloop and notification dispatch queue.
///
/// 5. **Explicit Lifecycle**: DispatchSource provides clear activation/cancellation semantics,
///    making testing and cleanup more predictable.
///
/// **Memory Pressure Response Strategy:**
///
/// - **Warning Level**: Release 50% of pooled buffers (largest first) to free memory while
///   maintaining some performance benefit. This is triggered when the system is under moderate
///   memory pressure but not critical.
///
/// - **Critical Level**: Release all pooled buffers immediately. System is at risk of
///   terminating processes, so we prioritize memory over performance.
///
/// The monitor automatically starts on first access to `shared` singleton and continues
/// monitoring until explicitly stopped via `stop()`.
///
/// **Usage Example:**
///
/// ```swift
/// // Automatic monitoring (recommended)
/// BufferPool.shared.enableMemoryPressureMonitoring()
///
/// // Or manual control
/// let monitor = MemoryPressureMonitor { level in
///     switch level {
///     case .warning:
///         print("Memory warning - reducing buffer pool")
///         BufferPool.shared.releaseHalf()
///     case .critical:
///         print("Memory critical - clearing buffer pool")
///         BufferPool.shared.clear()
///     }
/// }
/// monitor.start()
/// // Later...
/// monitor.stop()
/// ```
///
/// **Thread Safety:**
/// The monitor is thread-safe and can be started/stopped from any thread. Callbacks are
/// dispatched on a serial queue to ensure handlers don't run concurrently.
