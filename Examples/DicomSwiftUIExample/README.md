// Automatic windowing
DicomImageView(
    url: dicomURL,
    windowingMode: .automatic
)

// CT lung preset
DicomImageView(
    url: dicomURL,
    windowingMode: .preset(.lung)
)

// Custom window/level
DicomImageView(
    url: dicomURL,
    windowingMode: .custom(center: 50.0, width: 400.0)
)

// GPU accelerated
DicomImageView(
    url: dicomURL,
    windowingMode: .automatic,
    processingMode: .metal
)
```

### 2. WindowingControlView Examples

**Location**: `Views/WindowingExample.swift`

Demonstrates:
- Interactive window/level sliders
- Preset selection buttons
- Automatic optimal window calculation
- GPU vs CPU processing comparison
- Real-time image updates

### 3. SeriesNavigatorView Examples

**Location**: `Views/SeriesNavigatorExample.swift`

└── README.md                        # This file
```

## Code Patterns

All example views follow consistent patterns:

1. **State declarations** at the top using `@State`
2. **Enum-based demo modes** for switching between examples
3. **Body composition** with clear view builders
4. **Control panels** separate from image display
5. **Code snippets** showing the active example
6. **Helper methods** for file selection and formatting
7. **SwiftUI previews** for Xcode canvas support

## Troubleshooting

### App Won't Launch

- Ensure you're running from the repository root: `swift run DicomSwiftUIExample`
- Check that all dependencies are resolved: `swift package resolve`
- Verify Swift toolchain version: `swift --version` (requires 5.9+)

### File Won't Load

- Confirm file has `.dcm` extension
- Verify file is a valid DICOM format (not DICOMDIR or multi-frame)
- Check console output for specific error messages
- Try one of the included test files first

### Image Appears Black

- DICOM file may have embedded windowing that doesn't match content
- Try "Automatic Windowing" mode to recalculate optimal values
- Check that file contains pixel data (some DICOM files are metadata-only)

### Performance Issues

- Large images (>2048×2048) may be slow without GPU acceleration
- Enable GPU mode via `.processingMode: .metal` parameter
- Consider using `.auto` processing mode for adaptive selection
